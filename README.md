# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a React JS blog website.

- Phase I: create a blog that works.
- Phase II: create writer's blog website in the same vein as WebToons, Marvel, etc. But instead of visual focus, make it a focus on writing. Make it so that amateurs can create an account, upload their weekly novel updates, accrue followers, get likes on their content, get their content promoted on front page etc. It'll basically be like the YouTube of novels and articles.

## Available Scripts

In the blog-backend directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
